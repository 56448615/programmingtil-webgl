* NOTE: moved vendor and images out of folder.
  * Running from main directory instead inside this directory.

## CONCEPTS:

* Multiple Textures
* Promises.
  * Note: at some point I'll push fully to npm-style dependencies. But for now,
    I'm going to just use older style includes.
  * Promise can/will replace signals as well.
